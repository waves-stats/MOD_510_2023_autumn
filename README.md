# Mod510_2023

Hello lovely people: 
After our discussion today today, I have would like to suggest some ways we can be more efficient and have clearer communication:

1. **Coding**: Its critical(I feel ) that we individually solve the whole assignment ourselves, so we gain the full advantage of learning most from assignment. This has been the method we used so far and I think it works well.

2. **Text**: Theory and other text in that goes into the report, we work on overleaf. On overleaf the chapters can be split into individual documents and we can split that among ourselves to write. I will make a document layout and send a plan for who writes what part probably tomorrow. 

3. **Deadline** for finishing everything: 29/10/23. Please upload your notebooks onto GitHub no later than midnight.

4. **Final document compilation**: on Monday (30/10) we sit down after class (12:30-14:30) and compile the document into the final submission. We also divide the work on the final touches on whats missing and whats not and distribute responsibilities.

5. We have a final meeting where we sit together 02/11/23, before class (10-12). And finalize the submission. The document should be ready for submission this day.

6. **Communication** - it might be hard to ask questions and discuss theoretical things here, so if needed send a mail to everyone in the group and send a msg here, so we remember to check our mails. Otherwise, staying behind after class is a good way to have some face to face discussions on Difficulties you are facing.

I think these should be the ground rules. I welcome any suggestions anyone has if you feel things should be done differently.

Thanks :)
